# Sarcasm Detection in News Headline Dataset
Being able to detect sarcasm and irony is critical in understanding someoneâ€™s true
intention. This is especially a challenging task when working with text data, due to the
lack of tone and facial expressions as well as the inherent dependence of sarcasm on
the context.

In this project, we aimed at classifying sarcastic and ironic versions of news headlines from TheOnion website and the real headlines in the news, gathered from HuffPost website.
Bi/LSTM architecture with and without attention mechanism have been used, leveraging contextualized word embeddings from the
pre-trained language model, BERT.
